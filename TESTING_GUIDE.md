# Testing Guide for New Welcome Flow

## Quick Test Commands

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test on device/emulator:**
   - Launch app → should see cream welcome page
   - Swipe up → should see dark animated text
   - Swipe up again → should see star field → auto-navigate to auth

## What to Verify

### ✅ Page 1 (Cream Intro)
- [ ] Cream background displays
- [ ] Lottie animation loads (or fallback icon shows)
- [ ] "Welcome to Sunnah Steps" text appears
- [ ] Subtitle text is readable
- [ ] Up arrow indicator is visible
- [ ] Vertical swipe up works

### ✅ Page 2 (Animated Text)
- [ ] Dark background displays
- [ ] Text animation plays automatically
- [ ] "We live in a noisy world..." appears first
- [ ] "Free yourself from..." appears second
- [ ] Text is readable in white
- [ ] Vertical swipe up works

### ✅ Page 3 (Star Field)
- [ ] Dark background displays
- [ ] Star field animation plays (or loading indicator shows)
- [ ] After ~1.5 seconds, automatically navigates to auth screen
- [ ] No manual interaction needed

### ✅ Navigation Flow
- [ ] App starts with new welcome flow (not old welcome screen)
- [ ] After star field, lands on existing AuthScreen
- [ ] All existing auth functionality still works
- [ ] Firebase Auth state management preserved

## Troubleshooting

### If Lottie animations don't load:
- Check internet connection
- Fallback UI should display instead
- App should still function normally

### If navigation doesn't work:
- Check console for GoRouter errors
- Verify `/auth` route exists in main.dart
- Ensure Firebase initialization completes

### If pages don't swipe:
- Try vertical swipe gestures (not horizontal)
- Check if PageView is responding to touch
- Verify no overlay widgets blocking gestures

## Performance Notes

- Lottie animations are loaded from network (keeps APK size small)
- Star field auto-navigation prevents user from getting stuck
- All existing Firebase Auth logic is preserved
- No breaking changes to existing user flows
